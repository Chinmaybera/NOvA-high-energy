# NOvA-high-energy
This repository contains the _numerical data_ corresponding to the results presented in the paper entitled as
"Probing new physics scenarios using high energy events at the NOvA far detector". [arXiv:2506.04984](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04984)

In this study, we investigate the impact of the high energy (HE) neutrino events on the
sensitivity of the experiment to constrain the off-diagonal NSI parameters (𝜖_𝑒𝜇 and
𝜖_𝑒𝜏) and decoherence parameter Γ. In this regard, we analyze the HE simulated events (1 < 𝐸_𝜈 < 20 GeV) observed
in NuMI Off-axis 𝜈𝑒 Appearance (NOvA) experiment assuming the presence of 𝜖_𝑒𝜇
and 𝜖_𝑒𝜏 , one at a time. We analyze the degeneracy observed in the 𝜖_𝑒𝜏 including
events from 1 < 𝐸_𝜈 < 5 GeV and show that it gets removed once we include HE
events (signal + background) from 1 < 𝐸_𝜈 < 20 GeV. Further, we examine the role
of signal versus beam background events in removing this degeneracy. Further, we comparatively investigate
the uncertainty in the determination of 𝜃_23 parameter in the presence of decoherence
using NOvA analysis window 1 < 𝐸_𝜈 < 5 GeV and 1 < 𝐸_𝜈 < 20 GeV.
